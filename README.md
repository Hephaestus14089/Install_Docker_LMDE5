A bash script for installing the Docker Engine on Debian 11 or Linux Mint Debian Edition 5 "Elsie".

I have made this script by referring to the official Docker docs for installing the Docker Engine on Debian.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

The idea of making this bash script was inspired by an error I came across while trying to install the Docker Engine on LMDE 5 "Elsie".
The problem and solution is described in this article I wrote :-
